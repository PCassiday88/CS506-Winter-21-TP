2nd
Created human and AI classes, changed some scopes
and can play the game but no winner is declared

3rd
created judge class that calls a method to check for 
a winner 
added additional variables to control game play
checked for wins and ties
found some bugs (override square and counter off)
heavy refactoring
**Still no fix on override

**Still no true AI

have complete game minus true AI
	-Completed when more func was given to AI move (4th screenshot)
	-Fixed a bug on exiting the game (5th screenshot)
	-Refactored checkWinner (6th)

5th
Add the AI
-removed print statements out of Judge to prevent double printing
	or messages while checking to see if a move would win
-created a means to gen random numbers
-AI first checks to see if there is a move where it can win
-Next, it checks to see if there is a move that makes the human win
-Next, it looks for open corners
-Next, it takes the center
-Next, it takes any edge

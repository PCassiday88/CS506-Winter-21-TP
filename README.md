# CS506-Winter-21-TP
The tic_tac_toe_OOP.py was my initial work with a 3x3 and was more or less what was needed for a 3x3 without AI.

The TTT.py file has my most current work. It has 5x5 as well as the AI but I am refactoring the appearence at the moment because the spaces don't hold shape. I also noticed a bug in the random 
number generator that I didn't previously notice.
